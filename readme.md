# optimizations

A few optimization methods implemented for those (like me) who understand and learn through code. Homework for a Numerical Optimizations course, following the numerical optimization bible by Nocedal & Wright.

`optimizations.jl` contains the implementations, `functions.jl` stores problems and utilities to generate problems, while `experiments.jl` just connects these. Run `$ julia experiments.jl`.
